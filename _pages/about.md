Hi! I am a PhD student at the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/) research group and the [Foundational AI CDT](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) at University College London, advised by [F-X Briol](http://fxbriol.github.io/), [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io/), and [Carlo Ciliberto](http://cciliber.github.io/). Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon Research in Cambridge, where I worked on Alexa question answering (2015-2019), and then on Gaussian processes for supply chain emulation (2019-2021). I graduated from Part III in Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2014.

I develop statistical and machine learning methods with provable performance guarantees. My PhD work focusses on methods grounded in kernel and Gaussian process theory; recently, I became interested in methods for mathematical genomics.

I will happily respond to "Masha", but if you'd like to pronounce my last name, it's nah-sleed-nyk.
