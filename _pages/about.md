Hi! I am a first-year PhD student at the [Foundational AI CDT](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) at University College London, advised by [Dr. Fran√ßois-Xavier Briol](http://fxbriol.github.io/) and [Dr. Carlo Ciliberto](http://cciliber.github.io/). Prior to starting my PhD, I was a Machine Learning Scientist at Amazon Research in Cambridge, where I worked on Alexa question answering (2015-2019), and then on Gaussian processes for supply chain emulation (2019-2021). I graduated from Part III in Pure Mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2014.

My research interests lie broadly in the topics in Gaussian processes and kernel methods, and robustness properties thereof.

I will happily respond to "Masha", but if you'd like to pronounce my last name, it's nah-sleed-nyk, "y" as in "six".
